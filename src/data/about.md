My name is Piyush (Pee-u-sh). I'm a self-taught systems software engineer currently living and working in SF Bay Area. I've worked on massive scale projects within database kernels and high performance infrastructure systems. My interests lie in distributed systems, ML/AI (main focus on sparse LLM architectures and RL), and cloud computing.
